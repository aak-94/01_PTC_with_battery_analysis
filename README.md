 PTC heater with battery of EV simulation analyssis
## Intoduction 
Conventional heating system in the vehicle uses the exhaust gases as the primary source for heating the cabin. However the use of exhaust gases for the cabin heating is no longer reliable, since more efforts being taken to develop energy efficient and low emission vehicle. Positive temperature coefficient (PTC) elements have become an important element of the vehicle heating system. Considering the changing paradigm of the automobile industry the efficiency of the PTC heater has become the topic of interest.

## Simulink model and its purpose
The basic model of the PTC heater is developed using Matlab/Simulink which can be used and integrated with other study parameters for future study. Simple Mathematical model is used for this purpose. This study uses one sample data to validate the developed model.

## Result and analysis
The simulation is ran for just 10 sec. The SOC vs. Time plot shows reduction in SOC values in each time step. This illustrates that both models of PTC heater and Battery are successfully coupled.
